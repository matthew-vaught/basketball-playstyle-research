This repository contains all notebooks and supporting files for my research on the evolution of height and playstyle in the NBA from 2000 through 2024.

## Background & Motivation

The modern NBA has seen lineup shifts (small ball, positionless basketball) and evolving player archetypes. In particular:

- How has the **average height** of players changed over the past few decades?  
- How have playstyles (shot selection, spacing, roles) evolved?  
- Can we classify lineups into archetypes and detect transitions over time?

This project aims to quantify those shifts, analyze playstyle archetypes, and test whether lineup decisions (e.g. via ‚Äúsmall-ball‚Äù configurations) statistically correlate with performance gains.

## Data & Sources

- **NBA Player & Season Data** scraped from Basketball-Reference and various online sources (Selenium + BeautifulSoup).  
- Data spans the 2000‚Äì01 through 2023‚Äì24 seasons, focusing on both playstyle and height statistics.  
- Key features include per-season stats (points, rebounds, assists, shooting splits, usage), derived metrics (e.g. shot location shares, spacing), as well as height and athleticism statistics from then NBA combine.

## Methods & Tools

- **Tools & Libraries**: Python ‚Äî Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn/Matplotlib.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction / Clustering**:  
  - PCA (Principal Components Analysis)  
  - Ward‚Äôs hierarchical clustering  
  - Laplacian Eigenmaps (manifold embedding)  
  - Gap statistic / elbow methods for choosing cluster count  
- **Statistical Testing & Comparative Analyses**: regression slopes, p-values, performance differentials, lineup vs non-lineup comparisons.

## Key Findings & Insights

- The NBA has shifted to a "small-ball" era, with shorter teams on average and a quicker style of play with more 3 pointers being taken
- Specifically, teams have gone towards shorter overall lineups with traditional "big men" being replaced by slightly shorter, more athletic power forwards and centers
- During the early periods of this transition, teams who embodied the new playstyle and height trends the most (the most "trendy" teams) boasted a win percentage over **10% higher** than those teams who failed to adjust to the trend as quickly
- Visualizations (scatter plots, clustering maps, temporal embeddings) illustrate these transitions more eloquently.

## How to Explore / Use This Repo

1. Start with **Importing Data Notebooks/** to see how raw data is collected and cleaned.  
2. Move to **Reproducing Results Notebooks/** for the preliminary analysis: reproducing the results from a paper I found that used PCA and clustering to create archetypes for player playstyles.  
3. Explore **tSNE and LE Notebooks/** for the main analysis, where I primarily used Laplacian Eigenmaps and PCA to visualize high-dimensional height and playstyle metrics and determine long-term trends.  
4. Use files in **Important DataFrames/** to inspect intermediate artifacts.  
5. For additional research on how athleticicism covaried with the shift in height, see **Further Research/**.

## Limitations & Future Work

- Classification of PFs may miss hybrid or reclassified players.  
- Some seasons/players have missing data or outlier stats.  
- Future improvements could include:  
  - Extending scraping to more seasons 
  - Integrating tracking data (player movement, shot charts)  
  - Testing predictive models (e.g. archetype ‚Üí team success)
